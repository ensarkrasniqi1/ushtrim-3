<p> Mechanics (from ancient Greek μηχανικὴ τέχνη mechanikè téchne , German 'machine, trick, mode of operation' ) [ 1 ] [ 2 ] is the study of the movement and deformation of bodies and the forces acting on them in the natural sciences and engineering . In physics, mechanics is usually understood to mean classical mechanics . In the sub-field of theoretical physics, the term is often used as an abbreviation for theoretical mechanics . In engineering, it is usually understood to mean technical mechanics , which uses the methods and principles of classical mechanics to calculate machines or structures.

Both the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics contain classical mechanics as a special case.

Classical mechanics was founded in the 17th century essentially through the work of Isaac Newton and was thus the first natural science in the modern sense (see History of Classical Mechanics ).</p>


<p>Mechanics can be roughly divided into different sub-areas: Kinematics deals with the movement of bodies and describes primarily the trajectory , speed and acceleration of bodies without taking mass or forces into account. Dynamics expands the description of movements through mass and the acting forces . Dynamics is often divided into statics (forces in equilibrium) and kinetics (forces not in equilibrium). In engineering mechanics [ 3 ] , however, it is also divided into kinematics and kinetics and viewed as a sub-area that stands alongside statics.

In addition, specific sub-areas of mechanics can be classified according to many different criteria. [ 4 ]

The classification described above based on the consideration of forces results in:

Kinematics – without consideration of forces
Dynamics – taking forces into account</p>





<p>A classification according to state of aggregation looks like this:

mechanics of solid bodies ( solid mechanics )
Rigid body mechanics or stereomechanics [ 5 ] : systems of discrete mass points and indeformable bodies. It is divided into point mechanics , which ignores the rotations of the bodies, and gyroscopic theory , which focuses on the rotations.
Mechanics of elastic bodies: The theory of elasticity deals with elastic deformations, i.e. deformations that return to normal after the forces causing them are removed, like in a spring. An important sub-area is elastostatics for stationary bodies.
Mechanics of plastic bodies: The theory of plasticity deals with plastic deformations, i.e. deformations that do not disappear after the forces causing them are removed, such as with warm butter or when forging.
Fluid mechanics ( gases and liquids ): It can be further divided according to internal friction into mechanics of ideal gases or real gases and mechanics of frictionless and viscous liquids, as well as according to the fluid and the movement into statics (unmoved, at rest) and dynamics (moving):
Fluid statics : aerostatics (for gases), hydrostatics (for liquids)
Fluid dynamics : aerodynamics , hydrodynamics
The classification according to area of ​​application leads to:

Theoretical mechanics (also called “analytical mechanics”). In addition to the division into kinematics and dynamics, it can also be divided according to the formalism into: [ 6 ] [ 7 ]
Newtonian mechanics : The oldest method of representation, which goes back to Isaac Newton . It applies to unaccelerated reference systems ( inertial systems ). The solution of specific problems with limited movement options can be very complex.
Lagrange formalism : A representation that goes back to Joseph-Louis Lagrange and also applies to accelerated reference systems. It uses generalized coordinates and allows a much simpler solution to many problems, e.g. in systems with more than two bodies or with motion restrictions.
Hamiltonian mechanics : A very general representation by William Rowan Hamilton , which has advantages in celestial mechanics and is suitable for the connection of quantum mechanics in the theoretical framework of physics .
Technical mechanics . Usually divided into:
Statics : Resting rigid bodies
Strength of Materials : Deformable Solid Bodies
Dynamics : Moving Bodies
A classification according to the type of idealization leads to:

Point mechanics : It was founded by Isaac Newton and uses the highest possible idealization of real bodies as point masses .
Rigid body mechanics or stereomechanics: [ 5 ] indeformable bodies and systems of mass points with six degrees of freedom with the subfield of gyroscopic theory , which focuses on rotational motion with three degrees of freedom.
Continuum mechanics : continuously extended, deformable bodies, with the subdivision:
Mechanics of elastic bodies: The theory of elasticity deals with elastic deformations, i.e. deformations that return to normal after the forces causing them are removed, like in a spring. An important sub-area is elastostatics for stationary bodies.
Mechanics of plastic bodies: The theory of plasticity deals with plastic deformations, i.e. deformations that do not disappear after the forces causing them are removed, such as with warm butter or when forging.
Fluid mechanics and gas dynamics (fluid mechanics): liquids , gases and plasmas
Statistical mechanics (also statistical thermodynamics): statistical interaction of many mass points, with references in particular to thermodynamics . Statistical mechanics is a subfield of statistical physics .</p>
